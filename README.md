👋 **Hey there! I’m Rohit Gande (@rg-incognito)** – your friendly neighborhood coder!

🚀 **Backend Dev | Android Alchemist | AI Adventurer**

I speak **Java** fluently (probably better than I speak human). I also hang out with **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL** for backend magic.  
On the **Android** side, I’m busy crafting apps with custom map views and features so slick they could double as butter.

### 💡 **What I’m Cooking Up:**
- Playing mad scientist with **CrewAI** and cooking up AI models like **Llama**, **Ollama**, and **Hugging Face**—because why have one genius when you can have a team of them?
- A **browser extension** that automates web browsing (or as I like to call it, your future best friend for laziness).
- An **Android parking rental app** with custom maps that’ll make Google Maps jealous.

### 🎯 **Other Shenanigans:**
- Dabbling with **LLM Agents** to automate workflows (basically teaching robots to outwork me).
- Dreaming up crazy ideas to fix the world’s parking problems and maybe reinvent fintech while I’m at it.

### 📌 **Why We Should Team Up:**
If you need a coder who loves turning caffeine into clean, scalable code while cracking terrible jokes, I’m your person. Let’s build something awesome—and maybe a little weird—together.
